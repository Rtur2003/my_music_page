OVERTIME! THE MUSIC'S IN MY VEINS!\nHeart rate at two hundred, this is PURE INSANE!\nOne tower down, we're racing for the win\nHE HE HE HAW if I lose again!\nOVERTIME! OVERTIME! No room for mistakes!\nEverything I've got, my sanity at stake!\nMega Knight jumping, E-Barbs at the bridge\nThis is Clash Royale - living on the EDGE!\n\n[VERSE 2 - Toxic Warfare]\n(Emotion: Bitter rage mixed with dark humor)\nEvery midladder player got the SAME deck list\nOverleveled nightmares that shouldn't exist\n\"Just counter with Mini Pekka\" - BRO I HAD NO ELIXIR\nYour Firecracker, Wall Breakers - certified KILLER\nRage spell incoming, here comes the flood\nElite Barbarians running, thirsting for blood\nI'm cycling Skeletons, praying to RNG\nOne wrong placement, that's GG for me\n\n[BRIDGE - Breaking Point Emotions]\n(Emotion: Manic laughter mixed with tears, gaming psychosis)\nI've deleted my account five times this week\nBut I'm BACK tomorrow, emotionally weak\n\"Jarvis, I'm low on karma, post another meme\"\nCoping through humor - the Clasher's theme!\nMy fragile push, your seven-elixir \"NO\"\nSpawn damage deletion, watch my spirits go LOW\nBut in this final minute, everything's on fire\nOvertime adrenaline, taking me HIGHER!\n\n[FINAL CHORUS - Ultimate Climax]\n(Emotion: Transcendent gaming ecstasy mixed with inevitable doom)\nOVERTIME! OVERTIME! SIXTY SECONDS LEFT!\nVictory or crushing, soul-destroying death!\nRocket to the tower, it's a photo finish race\nHE HE HE HAW stamped across my FACE!\nOVERTIME! OVERTIME! This is what we LIVE FOR!\nToxic emote spam, settling the score!\nMega Knight META, E-Barbs at the gate\nIn Clash Royale overtime - WE EMBRACE OUR FATE!\n\n[OUTRO - Post-Battle Exhaustion]\n(Emotion: Hollow victory/defeat, emotional devastation)\nGame over, replay saved, what just happened there?\nThree-star destruction or one tower nightmare\nEither way I'm queueing up the next one RIGHT NOW\nClash Royale addiction - take another bow\nHE HE HE HAW... HE HE HE HAW...\n(fading into distance with maniacal echo)",
