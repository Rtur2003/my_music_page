# Admin Panel Setup Guide

## Setting Up Admin Authentication

The admin panel uses environment variables for secure authentication. Follow these steps:

### 1. Development Setup (Local Testing)

For local development, the admin panel uses a default key:
```
ADMIN_KEY = "HASAN_ARTHUR_ADMIN_2024"
```

### 2. Production Setup (Netlify)

1. **Go to your Netlify Dashboard**
   - Visit [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Navigate to your site

2. **Set Environment Variable**
   - Go to Site Settings > Environment Variables
   - Click "Add a variable"
   - Set:
     - **Key:** `ADMIN_KEY`
     - **Value:** Your secure admin password (choose something strong!)

3. **Deploy and Test**
   - Redeploy your site for changes to take effect
   - Access `/admin` or `/admin.html` on your live site
   - Enter your ADMIN_KEY to access the panel
